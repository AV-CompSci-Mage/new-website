## Modeling memory objects in gem5: Ports

**IMPORTANT**: This slide deck builds on top of what has already been developed in [Introduction to SimObjects](01-sim-objects-intro.md), [Debugging gem5](02-debugging-gem5.md), and [Event Driven Simulation](03-event-driven-sim.md).

---

- Idea of ports (request/response), packets, interface
- A simple memory object that forwards things
- Connecting ports and writing config files
- Adding stats to a SimObject
- Modeling bandwidth and latency with events

---

## Ports

In gem5, `SimObjects` can use `Ports` to send/request data. `Ports` are gem5's **main interface to the memory**. There are two types of `Ports` in gem5: `RequestPort` and `ResponsePort`.

As their names would suggest:

- `RequestPorts`  make `requests` and await `responses`.
- `ResponsePorts` await `requests` and send `responses`.

Make sure to differentiate between `request`/`response` and `data`. Both `requests` and `response` could have `data` with them.

---

## Packets

`Packets` are the facility that make communication through port happen. They can be `request` or `response`. **NOTE**: `Packet` in gem5 can change from a `request` to `response`. This happens when the `request` arrives at the `SimObject` that can respond to it.

Every `Packet` has the following fields:

- `Addr`: Address of the memory location being accessed.
- `Data`: Data associated with the `Packet` (data that `Packet` carries).
- `MemCmd`: It denotes what the `Packet` should do. Examples include: `readReq`/`readResp`/`writeReq`/`writeResp`.
- `RequestorID`: ID for the `SimObject` that created the request (requestor).

Class `Packet` is defined in `mem/packet.hh`. ‚ÄçNote that in our tutorial we will deal with `Packet` in pointers. `PacketPtr` is a type in gem5 that is equivalent to `Packet*`.

<!-- _class: code-50-percent -->

## Ports in gem5

Let's take a look at `src/mem/port.hh` to see the declaration for `Port` classes.

Let's focus on the following functions. These functions make the communication possible. Notice how `recvTimingReq` and `recvTimingResp` are `pure virtual` functions. This means that you can **not** instantiate an object of `RequestPort` or `ResponsePort` and have to extend them to implement them based on your use case.

```cpp
class RequestPort {
  ...
  public:
    bool sendTimingReq(PacketPtr pkt);
    // inherited from TimingRequestProtocol in `src/mem/protocol/timing.hh`
    virtual bool recvTimingResp(PacketPtr pkt) = 0;
    virtual void sendRetryResp();
   ...
};

class ResponsePort {
  ...
  public:
    bool sendTimingResp(PacketPtr pkt);
    // inherited from TimingResponseProtocol in `src/mem/protocol/timing.hh`
    virtual bool recvTimingReq(PacketPtr pkt) = 0;
    virtual void sendRetryReq();
   ...
};
```

---

## Access Modes: Timing, Atomic, Functional

`Ports` allow 3 modes of accessing the memory.

1- In `timing` mode, accesses advance simulator time. In this mode, `request` propagate down the memory hierarchy while each level imposes its latency and can potentially interleave processing of multiple requests. This mode is the only realistic mode in accessing the memory.
2- In `atomic` mode, accesses do not directly advance simulator time, rather it's left the **original** `requestor` to move simulator time. Accesses are done atomically (are **not** interleaved). This access mode is useful for fast-forwarding simulation.
3- In `functional` mode, access to the memory are done through a chain of function calls. `Functional` mode does not advance simulator time. All accesses are done in series and are not interleaved. This access mode is useful for initializing simulation from files, talking from the host to the simulator.

---

## Timing Protocol in Action

**IMPORTANT**: A `Port` can only be connected to **one other** `Port` that is of a different type, `RequestPort`/`ResponsePort` can only be connected to `ResponsePort`/`RequestPort`. If you look at `src/mem/port.hh` you'll see that class `RequestPort` has `private` member called `ResponsePort* _responsePort` that holds a pointer to the `ResponsePort` the `RequestPort` object is connected to (its `peer`). Moreover, if you look at the definition of `sendTimingReq`/`sendTimingResp` in `src/mem/port.hh` you'll see that they will call and return `peer::recvTimingReq`/`peer::recvTimingResp`.

Now let's look at 2 scenarios for communication, in these scenarios let's assume:

- `Requestor` is a `SimObject` that has a `RequestPort`.
- `Responder` is a `SimObject` that has a `ReponsePort`.

**NOTE**: Note that while in our scenarios `Requestor` and `Responder` have one `Port`, `SimObjects` can have multiple ports of different types.

## Scenario: Everything Goes Smoothly: Diagram

![ports_ladder_no_retry](04-ports-imgs/ports_ladder_no_retry.drawio.svg)

---

## Scenario: Everything Goes Smoothly

In this scenario:

1- `Requestor` sends a `Packet` as the `request` (e.g. `readReq`). In C++ terms `Requestor::RequestPort::sendTimingReq` is called which in turn calls `Responder::ResponsePort::recvTimingReq`.
2- `Responder` is not busy and accepts the `request`. In C++ terms `Responder::ResponsePort::recvTimingReq` returns true. Since `Requestor` has received true, it will receive a `response` in the future.
3- Simulator time advances, `Requestor` and `Responder` continues execution. When `Responder` has the `response` (e.g. `readResp`) ready, it will send the `response` to the `requestor`. In C++ terms `Responder::ResponsePort::sendTimingResp` is called which in turn calls `Requestor::RequestPort::recvTimingResp`.
4- `Requestor` is not busy and accepts the `response`. In C++ terms `Requestor::RequestPort::recvTimingResp` returns true. Since `Responder` has received true, the transaction is complete.

---

## Scenario: Responder Is Busy: Diagram

---

## Scenario: Responder Is Busy

In this scenario:

1- `Requestor` sends a `Packet` as the `request` (e.g. `readReq`).
2- `Responder` is busy and rejects the `request`. In C++ terms `Responder::ResponsePort::recvTimingReq` returns false. Since `Responder` returned false. Since `Requestor` has received true, it waits for a `retry request` from `Responder`.
3- When `Responder` becomes available (is not busy anymore), it will send a `retry request` to `Requestor`. In C++ terms `Responder::ResponsePort::sendReqRetry` is called which in turn calls `Requestor::RequestPort::recvReqRetry`.
4- `Requestor` sends the `blocked Packet` as the `request` (e.g. `readReq`).
5- `Responder` is not busy and accepts the `request`.
6- Simulator time advances, `Requestor` and `Responder` continue execution. When `Responder` has the `response` ready it will send the `response` to the `requestor`.
7- `Requestor` is not busy and can accept the `response`.

---

## Other Scenarios

There are two other possible scenarios:

1- A scenario where the `Requestor` is busy.
2- A scenario where both `Requestor` and `Responder` are busy.

**CAUTION**: Scenarios where `Requestor` is busy should not happen normally. In reality, the `Requestor` makes sure it can receive the `response` for a `request` when it sends the request. I have never run into a situation where I had to design my `SimObjects` in a way that the `Requestor` will return false when `recvTimingResp` is called. That's not to say that if you find yourself in a situation like this, you have done something wrong; BUT I would look really hard into my code/design and verify I'm simulating something realistic.

You can find the ladder diagrams for scenario 1 and 2 in the next slide.

## InspectorGadget

In this step, we will implement our new `SimObject` called `InspectorGadget`. `InspectorGadget` will monitor all the traffic to the memory and make sure all the traffic is safe. In this tutorial, we will do this in multiple steps as laid out below.

- Step 1: We will implement `InspectorGadget` to forward traffic from CPU to memory and back, causing latency for queueing traffic.
- Step 2: We will extend `InspectorGadget` to reject traffic to a certain address. It will return **all zeroes** for read traffic and ignore write traffic. To do this it will have to *inspect* the traffic, causing further delay (for `1 cycle`) for inspection.
- Step 3: We will extend `InpsectorGadget` like below:
  - It will do multiple inspection every cycle, resulting in higher traffic throughput.
  - It will expose `inspection_latency` as a parameter.
- Step 4: We will extend `InspectorGadget` to allow for pipelining of the inspections.

---

## InspectorGadget: Diagram

Here is a diagram of what `InspectorGadget` will look like eventually.

<!-- _class: start -->

## Step 1: Buffering Traffic

---
<!-- _class: code-60-percent -->

## ClockedObject

A `ClockedObject` is a child class of `SimObject` that provides facilities for managing time in `cycles`. Every `ClockedObject` has a `clk_domain` parameter that defines its clock frequency. Using the `clk_domain`, the `ClockedObject` provides functionalities like below:

- `clockEdge(Cycles n)`: A function that returns the time of the `nth` clock edge into the future.
- `nextCycle()`: A function that return the time of first clock edge into the future, i.e. `nextCycle() := clockEdge(Cycles(1))`.

This class is defined in `src/sim/clocked_object.hh` as shown below:

```cpp
class ClockedObject : public SimObject, public Clocked
{
  public:
    ClockedObject(const ClockedObjectParams &p);

    /** Parameters of ClockedObject */
    using Params = ClockedObjectParams;

    void serialize(CheckpointOut &cp) const override;
    void unserialize(CheckpointIn &cp) override;

    PowerState *powerState;
};
```

---

## InspectorGadget: Adding Files

Now let's go ahead and create a `SimObject` declaration file for `InspectorGadget`. Do it by running the following commands in the base gem5 directory.

```sh
mkdir bootcamp/inpsector-gadget
touch bootcamp/inspector-gadget/InspectorGadget.py
```

Now, let's also create a `SConscript` for registering `InspectorGadget`. Do it by running the following command in the base gem5 directory.

```sh
touch bootcamp/inspector-gadget/SConscript
```

---

## InspectoGadget: SimObject Declaration File

Now, inside `InspectorGadget.py`, let's define `InspectorGadget` as a `ClockedObject`. To do that, we need to import `ClockedObject`. Do it by adding the following line to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/InspectorGadget.py`.

```python
from m5.objects.ClockedObject import ClockedObject
```

The remaining part of the declaration is for now similar to that of `HelloSimObject` in [Introduction to SimOjbects](01-sim-objects-intro.md). Do that part on your own. When you are done, you can find my version of the code in the next slide.

---

## InspectorGadget: SimObject Declaration File So Far

This is how `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/InspectorGadget.py` should look like now:

```python
from m5.objects.ClockedObject import ClockedObject

class InspectorGadget(ClockedObject):
    type = "InspectorGadget"
    cxx_header = "bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh"
    cxx_class = "gem5::InspectorGadget"
```

---

## InspectorGadget: Ports in Python

So far we have looked at the declaration of `Ports` in C++. However, to create an instance of a C++ class in Python we need a declaration of that class in Python. `Ports` are defined under `src/python/m5/params.py`. However, `Ports` do not inherit from class `Param`. I strongly recommend that you take a short look at `src/python/m5/params.py`.

Try to find what kind of parameters you can add to any `SimObject`/`ClockedObject`.

Our next step is to define a `RequestPort` and a `ResponsePort` for `InspectorGadget`. To do this add the following import line to `InspectorGadget.py`.

```python
from m5.params import *
```

**NOTE**: My personal preference in python is to import modules very explicitly. However, when importing `m5.params`, I think it's ok to do import `*`. This is mainly because, when I'm creating `SimObjects`, I might need different kinds of parameters that I might not know about in advance.

---

## InspectorGadget: Adding Ports

Now, let's finally add two ports two `InspectorGadget`; One port will be on the side where the CPU would be in the computer system and one port will be on the side where the memory would be. Therefore, let's call them `cpu_side_port` and `mem_side_port` respectively.

**Question**: What type should `cpu_side_port` and `mem_side_port` be?

Before looking at the answer, try to answer the question for yourself.

**Answer**: `cpu_side_port` should be a `ResponsePort` and `mem_side_port` should be a `RequestPort`.

Make sure this answer makes sense to you, before moving on to the next slide.

---

## InspectorGadget: Adding Ports cont.

Add the following two lines under the declaration of `InspectorGadget` to add `cpu_side_port` and `mem_side_port`.

```python
    cpu_side_port = ResponsePort("ResponsePort to receive requests from CPU side.")
    mem_side_port = RequestPort("RequestPort to send received requests to memory side.")
```

To buffer traffic, we need two FIFOs: one for `requests` (from `cpu_side_port` to `mem_side_port`) and one for `responses` (from `mem_side_port` to `cpu_side_port`). For the the FIFO in the `request` path, we know that in the future we want to *inspect* the requests. Therefore, let's call it `inspectionBuffer`; we need a parameter to determine the the number of entries in this buffer so let's call that parameter `inspection_buffer_entries`. For the `response` path, we will simply call the buffer `response_buffer` and add a parameter for its entries named `response_buffer_entries`. Do it by adding the following lines under the declaration of `InspectorGadget`.

```python
inspection_buffer_entries = Param.Int("Number of entries in the inspection buffer.")
response_buffer_entries = Param.Int("Number of entries in the response buffer.")
```

---

## InspectorGadget: SimObject Declaration File

This is how `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh` should look like now.

```python
from m5.objects.ClockedObject import ClockedObject
from m5.params import *


class InspectorGadget(ClockedObject):
    type = "InspectorGadget"
    cxx_header = "bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh"
    cxx_class = "gem5::InspectorGadget"

    cpu_side_port = ResponsePort("ResponsePort to received requests from CPU side.")
    mem_side_port = RequestPort("RequestPort to send received requests to memory side.")

    inspection_buffer_entries = Param.Int("Number of entries in the inspection buffer.")
    response_buffer_entries = Param.Int("Number of entries in the response buffer.")
```

---

## Updating SConscript

Remember to register `InspectorGadget` as a `SimObject` as well as a `DebugFlag` for it. in `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`.

**NOTE**: In the next steps we will create `inspector_gadget.hh` and `inspector_gadget.cc`.

This is how `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/SConscript` should look like.

```python
Import("*")

SimObject("InspectorGadget.py", sim_objects=["InspectorGadget"])

Source("inspector_gadget.cc")

DebugFlag("InpsectorGadget")
```

---

## InspectorGadget: C++ Files

Now, let's go ahead and create a header and source file for `InspectorGadget` in `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget`. Remember to make sure the path to your header file matches that of what you specified in `cxx_header` in `InspectorGadget.py` and the path for your source file matches that of what you specified in `SConscript`. Run the following commands in the base gem5 directory to create the files.

```sh
touch src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh
touch src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc
```

Now, let's simply declare `InspectorGadget` as a class that inherits from `ClockedObject`. This means you have to import `sim/clocked_object.hh` instead of `sim/sim_object.hh`. Let's add everything that we have added in the Python to our class except for the `Ports`.

---
<!-- _class: code-60-percent -->

## InspectorGadget: Header File

```cpp
#ifndef __BOOTCAMP_INSPECTOR_GADGET_INSPECTOR_GADGET_HH__
#define __BOOTCAMP_INSPECTOR_GADGET_INSPECTOR_GADGET_HH__

#include "params/InspectorGadget.hh"
#include "sim/clocked_object.hh"

namespace gem5
{

class InspectorGadget : public ClockedObject
{
  private:
    int inspectionBufferEntries;
    int responseBufferEntries;

  public:
    InspectorGadget(const InspectorGadgetParams& params);
};


} // namespace gem5

#endif // __BOOTCAMP_INSPECTOR_GADGET_INSPECTOR_GADGET_HH__
```

---

## Extending Ports

If you remember `RequestPort` and `ResponsePort` classes were abstract classes, i.e. they had `pure virtual` functions which means objects can not be instantiated from that class. Therefore, for us to use `Ports` we need to extend the classes and implement their `pure virtual` functions.

Before anything, let's go ahead and import the header file that contains the declaration for `Port` classes. We also need to include `mem/packet.hh` since we will be dealing with `Packets` a lot (we're going to be moving them a lot). Do it by adding the following lines to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`.

```cpp
#include "mem/packet.hh"
#include "mem/port.hh"
```

**REMEMBER** to follow the right include order based on gem5's convention.

---
<!-- _class: code-50-percent -->

## Extending ResponsePort

Now, let's get to extending `ResponsePort` class. Let's do it inside the scope of `InspectorGadget` to prevent using names used by other gem5 developers. Let's go ahead an create `CPUSidePort` class that inherits from `ResponsePort` in the `private` scope. To do this, add the following code to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`.

```cpp
  private:
    class CPUSidePort: public ResponsePort
    {
      private:
        InspectorGadget* owner;

        bool needToSendRetry;

      public:
        CPUSidePort(InspectorGadget* owner, std::string& name):
            ResponsePort(name), owner(owner), needToSendRetry(false)
        {}

        bool needRetry() const { return needToSendRetry; }

        virtual AddrRangeList getAddrRanges() const override;

        virtual bool recvTimingReq(PacketPtr pkt) override;
        virtual Tick recvAtomic(PacketPtr pkt) override;
        virtual void recvFunctional(PacketPtr pkt) override;
        virtual void recvRespRetry() override;
    };
```

---

## Extending ResponsePort: Deeper Look

Here is a deeper look into the declaration of `CPUSidePort`.

1- We hold a pointer to the instance of `InspectorGadget` class that owns this instance of `CPUSidePort` class in `InspectorGadget* owner`. We do it to access the owner when we receive `requests`, i.e. when `recvTimingReq` is called.
2- We track a boolean value that tells us if we need to send a `retry request`. This happens when we reject a `request` because we are busy; when we are not busy we check this before sending a `retry request`.
3- In addition to all the functions that are used for moving packets, the class `ResponsePort` has another `pure virtual` function that will return an `AddrRangeList` which represent all the address ranges that the port can respond for. Note that in a system the memory addresses can be partitioned among ports. Class `RequestPort` has a function with the same name. However, it's not a `pure virtual` function and it will return `peer::getAddrRanges`.
4- We will need to implement all the functions that relate to moving packets (all the functions that start with `recv`). We will use `owner` to implement most of the functionality of these functions within `InspectorGadget`.

---
<!-- _class: code-60-percent -->

## Extending RequestPort

We're going to follow a similar approach for extending `RequestPort`. Let's create class `MemSidePort` that inherits from `RequestPort`. Again we'll do it in the `private` scope of `InspectorGadget`. Do it by adding the following code to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`.

```cpp
  private:
    class MemSidePort: public RequestPort
    {
      private:
        InspectorGadget* owner;

        PacketPtr blockedPacket;

      public:
        MemSidePort(InspectorGadget* owner, std::string& name):
            RequestPort(name), owner(owner), blockedPacket(nullptr)
        {}

        bool blocked() const { return blockedPacket != nullptr; }
        void sendPacket(PacketPtr pkt) override;

        virtual bool recvTimingResp(PacketPtr pkt) override;
        virtual void recvReqRetry() override;
    };
```

---

## Extending RequestPort: Deeper Look

Let's take a deeper look into what we added for class `MemSidePort`.

1- Like `CPUSidePort` we track a pointer to the instance of `InspectorGadget` class that owns this instance of `MemSidePort` in `InspectorGadget* owner`. We do it to access the owner when we receive `responses`, i.e. when `recvTimingResp` is called.
2- We track a pointer to one `Packet` that is blocked (has received false) the last time `MemSidePort::sendTimingReq` is called. `PacketPtr blockedPacket` holds that `Packet`.
3- Function `blocked` tells us if we are blocked by the memory side, i.e. still waiting to receive a `retry request` from memory side.
4- Function `sendPacket` is a wrapper around `sendTimingReq` to give our code more structure. Notice we don't need to definte `sendTimingReq` as it is already defined by `TimingRequestProtocol`.
5- We will need to implement all the functions that relate to moving packets (all the functions that start with `recv`). We will use `owner` to implement most of the functionality of these functions within `InspectorGadget`.

---

## Creating Instances of Ports in InspectorGadget

Now that we have declared `CPUSidePort` and `MemSidePort` classes (which are note abstract classes) we can go ahead and create an instance of each class in `InspectorGadget`. To do that, add the following two lines to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`

```cpp
  private:
    CPUSidePort cpuSidePort;
    MemSidePort memSidePort;
```

---
<!-- _class: code-50-percent -->

## SimObject::getPort

Let's take a look at `src/sim/sim_object.hh` again. You can find a declaration for a function called `getPort`. Below is a snippet of code from the declaration of class `SimObject`.

```cpp
  public:
/**
     * Get a port with a given name and index. This is used at binding time
     * and returns a reference to a protocol-agnostic port.
     *
     * gem5 has a request and response port interface. All memory objects
     * are connected together via ports. These ports provide a rigid
     * interface between these memory objects. These ports implement
     * three different memory system modes: timing, atomic, and
     * functional. The most important mode is the timing mode and here
     * timing mode is used for conducting cycle-level timing
     * experiments. The other modes are only used in special
     * circumstances and should *not* be used to conduct cycle-level
     * timing experiments. The other modes are only used in special
     * circumstances. These ports allow SimObjects to communicate with
     * each other.
     *
     * @param if_name Port name
     * @param idx Index in the case of a VectorPort
     *
     * @return A reference to the given port
     *
     * @ingroup api_simobject
     */
    virtual Port &getPort(const std::string &if_name, PortID idx=InvalidPortID);
```

---

## SimObject::getPort cont.

This function is used for connecting ports to each other. As far as we are concerned, we are to create a mapping between our `Port` objects in C++ and the `Ports` that we declare in Python. To the best of my knowledge, we will never have to call this function on our own. For now let's implement this function to return a `Port&` if we recognize `if_name` (which would be the name that we have given to the `Port` in Python), otherwise, we will ask `ClockedObject` to handle the function call.

Let's go ahead an add the declaration for this function to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`.

```cpp
  public:
    virtual Port& getPort(const std::string& if_name, PortID idxInvalidPortID);
```

---
<!-- _class: code-60-percent -->

## Enough with the Declarations! For Now!

So far, we have declared quite a few functions that we need to implement. Let's start defining some of them. In the next several slides, we will be defining functions from `CPUSidePort` and `MemSidePort` and `getPort` from `InspectorGadget`.

Open `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc` and let's start adding include statements and `namespace gem5`. Add the following piece of code to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc`. By now, you should why each line is added.

```cpp
#include "bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh"

#include "debug/InspectorGadget.hh"

namespace gem5
{

} // namespace gem5
```

As we start defining functions, we will realize that we will need to declare and define more functions. To keep things organized, let's just note them down as we go. We will the go back to declaring and defining.

---
<!-- _class: code-60-percent -->

## Defining InspectorGadget::getPort

Let's start by implementing `InspectorGadget::getPort`. Add the following code inside `namespace gem5` in `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc` to do this.

```cpp
Port&
InspectorGadget::getPort(const std::string &if_name, PortID idx)
{
    if (if_name == "cpu_side_port") {
        return cpuSidePort;
    } else if (if_name == "mem_side_port") {
        return memSidePort;
    } else {
        return ClockedObject::getPort(if_name, idx);
    }
}
```

If you remember, `getPort` needs to create a mapping between `Port` objects in Python and `Port` objects in C++. In this function for `if_name == cpu_side_port` (it's a name that comes from Python, look at `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/InspectorGadget.py`) we will retrun `cpuSidePort` and we do the same thing for `mem_side_port`. For now, you don't have to worry about `idx`. We will talk about it later in the context of `VectorPorts` (Ports that can connect to multiple peers).

---

## Defining Functions from CPUSidePort

Now, that we have implemented `InspectorGadget::getPort`, we can start declaring and the functions that simulate the `request` path (from `cpu_side_port` to `mem_side_port`) in `InspectorGadget`. Here are all the functions that we need to define from `CPUSidePort`.

```cpp
virtual AddrRangeList getAddrRanges() const override;

virtual bool recvTimingReq(PacketPtr pkt) override;
virtual Tick recvAtomic(PacketPtr pkt) override;
virtual void recvFunctional(PacketPtr pkt) override;
virtual void recvRespRetry() override;
```

As we start defining these functions you will see that `Ports` are interfaces between `SimObject` to communicate. Most of these functions rely on `InspectorGadget` to provide most of the functionality.

---
<!-- _class: code-50-percent -->
## CPUSidePort::recvAtomic, CPUSidePort::recvFunctional

These two functions are very simple to define. Basically our responsibility is to pass the `PacketPtr` to `SimObjects` further down in the memory hierarchy. To implement them we will call functions with the same name from `InspectorGadget`. Add the following code to define `CPUSidePort::recvAtomic` and `CPUSidePort::recvFunctional`.

```cpp
Tick
InspectorGadget::CPUSidePort::recvAtomic(PacketPtr pkt)
{
    DPRINTF(InspectorGadget, "%s: Received pkt: %s in atomic mode.\n", __func__, pkt->print());
    return owner->recvAtomic(pkt);
}

void
InspectorGadget::CPUSidePort::recvFunctional(PacketPtr pkt)
{
    DPRINTF(InspectorGadget, "%s: Received pkt: %s in functional mode.\n", __func__, pkt->print());
    owner->recvFunctional(pkt);
}
```

**DECLARE**:
`Tick InspectorGadget::recvAtomic(PacketPtr);`
`void InspectorGadget::recvFunctional(PakcetPtr);`

---

## CPUSidePort::getAddrRanges

Reminder: This function returns an `AddrRangeList` that represents the address ranges that the port is a responder for. To under this better think about dual channel memory. Each channel in the memory is responsible for a subsets of all the addresses in your computer.

To define this function, we are again going to rely on `InspectorGadget` and call a function with the same name from `InspectorGadget`. Do this by adding the following code to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc`

```cpp
AddrRangeList
InspectorGadget::CPUSidePort::getAddrRanges() const
{
    return owner->getAddrRanges();
}
```

**DECLARE**:
`AddrRangeList InspectorGadget::getAddrRanges() const;`

## CPUSidePort::recvTimingReq

In this function we will do the following.

Ask owner to receive the `Packet` the `Port` is receiving. To do this we will call a function with the same name from `InspectorGadget`. If `InspectorGadget` can accept the `Packet` then the `Port` will return true. Otherwise, the `Port` will return false as well as remember that we need to send a `retry request` in the future, i.e. we will set `needToSendRetry = true`.

To define this function add the following code to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc`.

```cpp
bool
InspectorGadget::CPUSidePort::recvTimingReq(PacketPtr pkt)
{
    DPRINTF(InspectorGadget, "%s: Received pkt: %s in timing mode.\n", __func__, pkt->print());
    if (owner->recvTimingReq(pkt)) {
        return true;
    }
    needToSendRetry = true;
    return false;
}
```

**DECLARE**:
`bool InspectorGadget::recvTimingReq(PacketPtr);`

---

## CPUSidePort::recvRespRetry

This function is called, when `RequestPort` connected to this port has sent a `response retry`. This happens after a scenario where the `RequestPort` connected to `CPUSidePort` rejects a response `Packet` and sends a `retry response` later.

To define this function we're going to call a function with the same name from `InspectorGadget`. Add the following code to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc` to define this function.

```cpp
void
InspectorGadget::CPUSidePort::recvRespRetry()
{
    DPRINTF(InspectorGadget, "%s: Received retry signal.\n", __func__);
    owner->recvRespRetry();
}
```

**DECLARE**:
`void InspectorGadget::recvRespRetry();`

---

## Back to Declaration

Now that we are finished with defining functions from `CPUSidePort`, let's go ahead and declare the functions from `InspectorGadget` that we noted down.

To do this add the following code to the `public` scope of `InspectorGadget` in `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`.

```cpp
  public:
    bool recvTimingReq(PacketPtr pkt);
    Tick recvAtomic(PacketPtr pkt) const;
    void recvFunctional(PacketPtr pkt) const;
    void recvRespRetry();
```

---

## TimedQueue

As we mentioned, in the first step, all `InspectorGadget` does do would be to buffer the traffic, forwarding `requests` and `responses`. To do that let's create a first in first out structure for `inspectionBuffer` and `responseBuffer`. We will wrap `std::queue` to expose the following functionalities, the purpose of this structure is impose a minimum latency after items are pushed to the queue and before they can be accessed. We will add a member variable called `latency` to make this delay configurable.

1- Method `front` that will return a reference to the oldest item in the queue similar to `std::queue`.
2- Method `pop` that will remove the oldest item in the queue, similar to `std::queue`.
3- Method `push` that will add a new item to the queue as well as tracking the simulation time the item was inserted. It is useful for ensuring a minimum amount of time has passed before making it ready to be accessed (modeling latency).
4- Method `empty` that will return true if queue is empty, similar to `std::queue`.
5- Method `size` that will return the number of items in the queue, similar to `std::queue`.
6- Method `hasReady` will return true if an item in the queue can be accessed at a given time (i.e. has spent a minimum latency in the queue).

### Timed Queue: Details

Like `CPUSidePort` and `MemSidePort`, let's declare our class `TimedQueue` in the `private` scope of `InspectorGadget`. Do it by adding the following lines to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`.


```cpp
  private:
    template<typename T>
    class TimedQueue
    {
      private:
        Tick latency;

        std::queue<T> items;
        std::queue<T> insertionTimes;

      public:
        TimedQueue(Tick latency): latency(latency) {}

        void push(T item, Tick insertion_time) {
            items.push(item);
            insertionTimes.push(insertion_time);
        }

        void pop() {
            items.pop();
            insertionTimes.pop();
        }

        T& front() const { return items.front(); }

        bool empty() const { return items.empty(); }

        size_t size() const { return items.size(); }

        bool hasReady(Tick current_time) const {
            if (empty()) {
                return false;
            }
            return (current_time - insertionTimes.front()) >= latency;
        }
    };
```

---

## inspectionBuffer

Now, let's declare an instance of `TimedQueue` to buffer `PacketPtr` that `InspectorGadget` receives from `InspectorGadget::cpuSidePort::recvTimingReq`. Add the following line to the `private` scope of class `InspectorGadget` to do this.

```cpp
  private:
    TimedQueue<PacketPtr> inspectionBuffer;
```

Now that we have declared `inspectionBuffer`, we are ready to define the following functions. **NOTE**: For now we are focusing on the `request` path, i.e. we're not going to define `recvRespRetry` just yet.

```cpp
AddrRangeList getAddrRanges() const;
bool recvTimingReq(PacketPtr pkt);
Tick recvAtomic(PacketPtr pkt) const;
void recvFunctional(PacketPtr pkt) const;
```

---
<!-- _class: code-60-percent -->

## Let's Get the Easy Ones Out the Way

Between the four functions, `getAddrRanges` and `recvFunctional` are the most straight-forward functions to define. We just need to call the same functions from `memSidePort`. To define these two functions, add the following code under `namespace gem5` in `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc`.

```cpp
AddrRangeList
InspectorGadget::getAddrRanges()
{
    return memSidePort.getAddrRanges();
}

void
InspectorGadget::recvFunctional(PacketPtr pkt)
{
    memSidePort.sendFunctional(pkt);
}
```

**NOTE**: These two functions are already defined by `RequestPort` and we don't need to redefine them. Notice, how for `Ports` you only have to define functions that relate to receiving signals.

---

## InspectorGadget::recvAtomic

Looking at the `recvAtomic`, this function returns a value of type `Tick`. This value is supposed to represent the latency of the access if that access was done in singularity, i.e atomically/without being interleaved. **CAUTION**: This latency is not an accurate representation of the actual latency of the access in a real setup. In a real setup there are many accesses happening at the same time and most of the time accesses do not happen atomically.

Let's add *one* cycle of latency to the latency of accesses in the lower level of memory hierarchy. To do this we are going to call `period` method from the parent class of `InspectorGadget` which is `ClockedObject`. This function return the period of the `clk_domain` in `Ticks`. Add the following code for definition of `InspectorGadget::recvAtomic` to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.cc`.

```cpp
Tick
InspectorGadget::recvAtomic(PacketPtr pkt)
{
    return period() + memSidePort.sendAtomic(pkt);
}
```

<!-- _class: code-80-percent -->

## On to the Hard Part

As we discussed before, `timing` accesses are the accesses that advance simulator time and represent real setups.
`InspectorGadget::recvTimingReq` will need check if there is at least one entry available in the `inspectionBuffer`. If there are no entries left, it should return false; otherwise, it should place the `Packet` at the end of the buffer, i.e. call `push` from `inspectionBuffer`, and return true.

To define `InspectorGadget::recvTimingReq`, add the following code under `namespace gem5` to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector-gadget.cc`.

```cpp
bool
InspectorGadget::recvTimingReq(PacketPtr pkt)
{
    if (inspectionBuffer.size() >= inspectionBufferEntries) {
        return false;
    }
    inspectionBuffer.push(pkt, curTick());
    return true;
}
```

## We're Not Done Yet!

So far, we have managed to program the movement of `Packets` from `cpuSidePort` into `inspectionBuffer`. Now what we need to do is send the `Packets` that are inside `inspectionBuffer` to `memSidePort`.

One would ask, why not `memSidePort.sendTimingReq` inside `InspectorGadget::recvTimingReq`? The answer is because we want to impose a latency on the movement of the `Packet` through `inspectionBuffer`. Think about how the real hardware would work. If the `Packet` is available on `cpuSidePort` on the rising edge of the clock, it would go inside `inspectionBuffer` by the falling edge of the clock, i.e. time will pass. Now, assuming that `Packet` is at the front of `inspectionBuffer`, it will be available on the rising edge of the next clock cycle. If you remember, we use `events` to make things happen in the future, by defining callback functions.

Now, let's go ahead and declare a `EventFunctionWrapper` for picking the `Packet` at the front of `inspectionBuffer` and sending it through `memSidePort`.

---

## nextReqSendEvent

We're going to declare `EventFunctionWrapper nextReqSendEvent` to send `Packets` through `memSidePort`. Remember what we need to do?

Add the following include statement to include the appropriate header file for class `EventFunctionWrapper`.

```cpp
#include "sim/eventq.hh"
```

If you remember from [Event Driven Simulation](/slides/03-Developing-gem5-models/03-event-driven-sim.md), we also need to declare a `std::function<void>()` to pass as the callback function for `nextReqSendEvent`. I would like to name these functions with `process` prefixing the name of the `event`. Let's go ahead and declare `nextReqSendEvent` as well as its callback function in the `private` scope of `InspectorGadget`. Do it by adding the following lines to `src/bootcamp/inspector-gadget/inspector_gadget.hh`.

```cpp
  private:
    EventFunctionWrapper nextReqSendEvent;
    void processNextReqSendEvent();
```

---

## Managing the Schedule of nextReqSendEvent

Now, that we have declared
