## Our goals for the gem5 bootcamp

- Make gem5 less painful and flatten the learning curve
- Give you a vocabulary for asking questions​
- Provide a reference for the future​
- Give you material to take back and teach your colleagues

---

## How this is going to work

- We'll be going mostly top-down
- Highly iterative:
  - You'll see the same thing over and over
  - Each time it will be one level deeper
- Lots of coding examples
  - Both live coding and practice problems

---

## Other admin things

- [Bootcamp website]()
- [Source for bootcamp materials]() (You'll work here)
- [GitHub Classroom]() (Needed to use codespaces)
- [gem5 Slack]() (for asking offline questions)
